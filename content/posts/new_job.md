summary: I just started a post-doc at LPG!

This September, I moved from Japan to France, starting a new position at the Laboratoire de Planétologie et Géodynamique, in the wonderful city of Nantes, France. I will work 6 months on finishing up a couple of papers and projects with people from both Nantes and Tokyo, and then I'll start a Marie Curie Fellowship in the same institute!

I'm super excited by this new adventure, and looking forward to the discussions with my new colleagues here in Nantes.

It also means I'm back in Europe, so I'll be able to visit labs here more easily!
