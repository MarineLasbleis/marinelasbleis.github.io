summary: Two posters at AGU 2018

Next week, it's AGU Fall meeting time!

I'll be presenting two posters on inner core, one focus on the Earth, and a second one focus on exoplanets. I'll also be chairing the SEDI Core session on Thursday morning (starting 8am).

Feel free to stop me for a coffee or lunch!
