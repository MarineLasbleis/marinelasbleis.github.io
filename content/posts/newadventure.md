summary: New adventure, outside academia

After more than 10 years looking towards the center of planets, deep into our core and other terrestrial planets, I have decided to change my perspective and move on new projects. 

During these 10 years, I grew up as a scientist. I met colleagues who became friends, I learned a lot from them and from students I worked with. I got funded to study the deepest part of our planet, but I also received many rejections from journals, grants, universities. I traveled around the world for conferences and collaborations. 

I am sure my new adventure, a foot outside academia, will provide me with new opportunities and challenges. I am looking forward to them, and please don't hesitate to contact me if needed. I'll try to keep this website going on, with maybe more science communication.
