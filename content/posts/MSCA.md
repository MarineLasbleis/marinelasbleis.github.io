summary: I started my project InDyMag on March this year

In March 2019, I started a new project and a new position. I am now officially a MSCA-IF Post doctoral fellow. More info on MSCA-IF (Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship) on the [European Commission website (for this year call, for example)](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/news/2019-msca-call-individual-fellowships-open_en). This is an incredible opportunity for me, and the reason I came back to Europe last year. 

The project InDyMag is about investigating the long term evolution of planetary cores, with a particular interest for the magnetic field. Basically, how a core evolves and crystallizes and the implications for predictions and observations of magnetic field. 

Stay tuned for new results soon, and I will be talking at the [EPSC-DPS](https://www.epsc-dps2019.eu/) meeting mid-September in Geneva!
