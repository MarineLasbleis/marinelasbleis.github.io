summary: New paper published in Geophysical Research Letters

We published a new work in Geophysical Research Letters:[the fate of liquids trapped during the Earth's inner core growth](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019GL085654). This is about compaction of a mushy inner core, and what we can learn about the supercooling hypothesis (delayed nucleation).
