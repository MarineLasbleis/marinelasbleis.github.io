ELSI is part of the World Premier International Research Center Initiative (WPI) of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT.) in Japan. Every year or almost, all researchers and professors in ELSI are presenting their research to a WPI committee. 

This year, I will be presenting my on-going research on the stratified layers in the Earth's core at this meeting!
