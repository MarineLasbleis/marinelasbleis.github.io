	      <h1>PhD : dynamics and evolution of the Earth's inner core</h1>

<h2> Research</h2>

<p>In the past thirty years, our understanding of the inner core
	      structure has increased with the number of seismic
	      studies. Observations reveal a global anisotropy with a
	      cylindrical symmetry and radial and lateral
	      heterogeneities. In this work, I have studied different
	      hypothesis on the dynamics of the inner core to explain
	      these observations. Revisiting the dynamics induced by
	      the Lorentz force, we studied the effect of new boundary
	      conditions, the effect of stratification and growth
	      rate. However, the obtained flow is not strong enough to
	      deform the media for viscosities larger than 1012 Pa.s,
	      in the lower bound of the published inner core
	      estimates. Deformation mechanisms can be subdivided
	      between natural convection (arising from unstable
	      thermal or compositional gradients) and externally
	      forced flows, like the one induced by the Lorentz
	      force. Recent estimates of the thermal diffusivity of
	      iron at high pressure limit the possibility of thermal
	      convection to an age of the inner core lower than a
	      hundred of millions years. Two key parameters emerge for
	      the inner core dynamics: the sign and strength of the
	      density stratification and the viscosity of the inner
	      core. We construct a regime diagram for the Earth's
	      inner core dynamics that compares the different
	      published models in term of maximum instantaneous
	      deformation rate. This diagram allows us to compare both
	      expected strain rate and deformation geometry with the
	      seismic observations. However, we find that no published
	      model can explain all the seismic observations. The
	      inner core anisotropy and the hemispherical dichotomy
	      are especially difficult to reconcile with these
	      models. The F-Layer is a 200km anomalous layer at the
bottom of the outer that presents low P-Wave velocities compared to
well-Mixed model. It has been interpreted as a layer depleted in light
elements, whereas we usually consider that light elements are expelled
at the surface of the inner core by freezing of the outer core
alloy. We study the hypothesis of freezing in the bulk of the layer,
with iron particles growing and settling in an increasingly depleted
liquid.</p>
